The food container is a flex: #foodblock

    within that; there are two components : 1: image container    #foodimage
                                            2: Text container     #content
                                                    inside content; there are two container
                                                    2.a Name and price of food      #nameprice
                                                            2.a.1 - first div - name
                                                            2.a.2 - seconf div - price
                                                    2.b desciprion and add button   #desnadd
                                                            2.b.1 - first div - desciprion
                                                            2.b.2 - second div - button


Now the flex magic:

    | foodblock   -   display: flex                                                             |
    | foodimage    |   content : flex-grow: 8                                                   |
    |              |    nameprice:display: flex; justify-content: space-between;                |
    |              |    descadd  :display: flex; justify-content: space-between;                |    

where flex is applied: its effect is in chold block"
        by default:  div block property is removed and they become inline like in nameprice div : child-div name and price acts as flex box components:
